### Level 3

Commander Jeffrey David Sinclair: Everyone lies, Michael. The innocent lie because they don't want to be blamed for something they didn't do and the guilty lie because they don't have any other choice. Lt. Corwin: Do we trust no-one then? Cmdr. Susan Ivanova: No, trust Ivanova, trust yourself, anybody else, shoot'em. Susan Ivanova: If I live through this without completely losing my mind, it will be a miracle of Biblical proportions. 

Lt. Corwin: [aside] Well, there goes my faith in the Almighty. [Opening narration, season 3] Susan Ivanova: The Babylon Project was our last, best hope for peace. It failed. But in the year of the Shadow War, it became something greater: our last, best hope for victory. The year is 2260. The place - Babylon 5. Alfred Bester: Being a telepath means you're special and rare and valuable.


#### Level 4

Delenn: We are star stuff. We are the universe made manifest trying to figure itself out. 

Captain John Sheridan: If more of our so-called leaders would walk the same streets as the people who voted them in, live in the same buildings, eat the same food instead of hiding behind glass and steel and bodyguards, maybe we'd get better leadership and a little more concern for the future.

Kosh Naranek: Understanding is a three-edged sword. Alfred Bester: Much as it might offend their sense of perspective, not everything is about Babylon 5.
